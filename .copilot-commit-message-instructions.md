# Commit Message Guidelines

- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for commit messages
- Add scope in parentheses after the type if applicable
- Use the imperative mood ("Fix bug" not "Fixed bug" or "Fixes bug")
- Keep the first line short (50 characters or less)
- Provide a summary in the body after a blank line
- If only version is changed, do not include a body
- Use bullet points for lists. Start each bullet point with a `-` and uppercase the first letter of the first word. Do not end bullet points with a period
- add `BREAKING CHANGE:` prefix to the body for breaking changes
- Wrap the body at 72 characters
