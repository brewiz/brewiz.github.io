# Commit Message Guidelines

- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for commit messages.
- Use the imperative mood ("Fix bug" not "Fixed bug" or "Fixes bug").
- Keep the first line short (50 characters or less).
- Provide a summary in the body after a blank line.
- If only version is changed, do not include a body.
- Use bullet points for lists.
- Wrap the body at 72 characters.
