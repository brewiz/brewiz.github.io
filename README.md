## Features

- ðŸŽ¯ Visual package selection interface
- ðŸ“¦ Browse packages by categories
- ðŸ”„ Real-time command generation
- ðŸš€ One-click copy of commands
- ðŸ’« Responsive design
- ðŸŽ¨ Visual status indicators for installed/outdated packages

## Usage

The easiest way to use Brewiz is to add the following alias to your shell configuration file (e.g., `~/.zshrc`) and then run `brewiz` in your terminal:

```bash
alias brewiz='/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://brewiz.github.io/bin/brewiz)" --'
```

Alternatively, you can download the script from GitHub and run it directly:

```bash
curl -fsSL -O brewiz https://brewiz.github.io/bin/brewiz
chmod +x brewiz
./brewiz
```

The Script will start the Brewiz server and open the application in your default browser. If the browser does not open automatically, you can navigate to `http://localhost:8047` manually. The Brewiz server will run in the background until you stop it.

Now you can browse the available packages, select the ones you want to install, and copy the generated command to your terminal.
